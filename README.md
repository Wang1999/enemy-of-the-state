# Enemy of the State

Presentation for [CocoaConf Mini
Austin](http://cocoaconf.com/austin-2014/sessions/enemy-of-state) in April 2014.
It's going to be an hour long.

I'd really value the feedback of anyone who has it, but please don't feel
obligated. You're welcome to unwatch this repo if you're too busy, or
uninterested in this talk before it's ready.

You can check out the prerendered PDF in here, though it may be slightly behind
the keynote at any given time. File issues or leave comments for anything you
think could be improved. :heart:
